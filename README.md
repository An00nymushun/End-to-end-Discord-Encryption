SimpleDiscordCrypt

Discord message encryption plugin, it gives end-to-end client side encryption for your messages and files with automatic key exchange, works without BetterDiscord.

Install it as a [userscript](https://gitlab.com/An0/SimpleDiscordCrypt/raw/master/SimpleDiscordCrypt.user.js) or include the js file somehow else

If you have Discord installed, use the [installer](https://gitlab.com/An0/SimpleDiscordCrypt/raw/master/SimpleDiscordCryptInstaller.ps1) (right click and Run with PowerShell)

Right click on the lock icon to open the menu

If you would like to download an encrypted image, middle click on "Open original"


EDCH P-521 is used for the key exchange and AES256-CBC for the messages

I hope this is actually simple as the name suggests
