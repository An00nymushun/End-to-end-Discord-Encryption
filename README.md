SimpleDiscordCrypt

Discord message encryption plugin

Install it as a [userscript](https://gitlab.com/An0/SimpleDiscordCrypt/raw/master/SimpleDiscordCrypt.user.js) or include the js file somehow else

If you have Discord installed, use the [installer](https://gitlab.com/An0/SimpleDiscordCrypt/raw/master/SimpleDiscordCryptInstaller.ps1) (right click and Run with PowerShell)

I hope this is actually simple as the name suggests
